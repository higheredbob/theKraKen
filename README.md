# theKraKen
Linux icon set, inspired by sugar and several Faenza sets, material and font-awesome as the base.

The sugar theme lays the overall basis for KraKen, and in the main core of icons, you can see the
influence in many of the icons. But, sugar (not the Linux OS icons, an older set) is really dated
and although it was a colorful and wonderful theme at the time, it shows it's age today. Hence my
desire to create KraKen, I enjoy full robust themes, and most themes have moved towards flat designs.
I really enjoy depth to my icons, so I decided to re-invision Sugar.

However, sugar didn't have a lot of icons to start with, I believe it had 110-130 icons total. I 
was only able to find 32 icons, and a portion of those weren't usable (folders, some icons aimed
more at phones than a desktop, etc). So, I borrowed from another long dead theme, this time from KDE,
to beef up the core "direction" that would shape KraKen. That theme was beggeljuse, and I'm quite certain
I don't know how to spell it... This theme borrowed it's inspiration from Faenza, which I leaned on stylistically
to update the two sets into the modern era of icons.The three sets from Faenza that you'll no doubt see the 
influence they had, as KraKen took on a life of it's own.

So, what do you get when you cross Sugar with Beggeljuse? A colorful icon set, that has deep buttons, walking a 
fine edge between blinding colors and realism. I would like to thank the creators of those sets, and also the Faenza
forks, Obsidian, Mine (yosemite), and Darkenza, which likely had just a big influence on the direction of KraKen, 
just because they look awesome, and it would of been really hard to bring the amount of icons to bear since both 
sugar and beggel, only totaled maybe 100 icons if combined, and only maybe 30 of those would of been useful. But,
I believe the overall ideas that shaped those sets, also shaped KraKen. This beta release without action icons,
is nearly 1000 icons. and I still have about 50-100 core icons that either I haven't had the time to force in, or
they haven't been "cleaned" up (I.E. metadata trimmed, useless parts of xml discarded, colors leveled, etc).

The basis of the update, is driven by the Material guidelines, and Font Awesome icons. I tried to adhere to
material where possible, I would say it's probably 85% material. But sometimes, the look I was going for,
material wasn't cutting it, and Font Awesome stepped up. That's just me though, and my own tastes. I hope you
enjoy this set, as much as I do. And in very short order, I will be releasing, 400-500 of the action icons. In the meantime, feel free to inherit your favorite icon set's, so you can fill any gaps during the beta.

Keep in mind, I am only one person, and I'm the only one who does the work on KraKen, so short order will still be
longer than any of the major icon sets.But, the icons are really tipping the scales of amazing, so you might not get
10,000 icons, but they will all be stunning and hopefully they add a uniqness to your repitoire of icon themes.

Again, thanks to Sugar, Beggeljuse, Faenza, Deviant Art, Nick's awesome Inkscape tutorials (logo's by Nick), and everyone else who creates icons that helped to form KraKen. ** side note ** if one of your Icon's did make it into
KraKen and I didn't get the attribution right, or you need something from me, please don't hesitate to drop me a line.
